[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/0a441739-df3f-4ebd-9ff6-b96855a2308d/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/mikedecr/deploys)

To do:

- delete blog posts
- Netlify. It's time.
- Color theme
- syntax highlight theme
- Site title on home page
    - April Hill's website has a function that detects current page and then throttles title appearance?
- remove contact info
- summaries in teaching list entries
- footer is lame
- paper PDFs on research page (static/papers)
- decision on "About" photo
- author blurb at the bottom of a post is weird, contains "role" (remove this) and "bio"

Resolved:

- no logo in navbar
- social img
- Fonts
- fix math
    - we are rendering to markdown (takes more advantage of theme components)
    - "unprotect" the markdown (theme loads mathjax)
    - need to double escape line breaks
