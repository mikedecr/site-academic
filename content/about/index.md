I am a PhD-trained statistical researcher working in quantitative finance and high-frequency trading.
I joined [DRW Holdings](https://drw.com/) in Chicago as a quantitative researcher in October 2020.

I like to build hierarchical / Bayesian / generative models for latent variables, discrete count data, and time series.
I work in R and Python, building models mostly with "pure" [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) and [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/).

I hold a Ph.D. in political science from the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison, where I studied U.S. elections, public opinion, and quantitative methodology with the [Elections Research Center](https://elections.wisc.edu/).
My dissertation developed new Bayesian methods for measuring political ideology in the electorate and modeling its causal effects in national elections.
My other projects covered voter identification requirements, election forecasts, and electoral cleavages such as the U.S. "gender gap."
My research is published in the _Election Law Journal_ and _The Forum_ and has been covered by the New York Times, the Washington Post, Mother Jones, FiveThirtyEight, and more.

<!-- I grew up in St. Louis MO and completed undergrad at the University of Missouri.
I've spent a few summers in Berkeley CA as well. -->

In my leisure time, I like to play guitar (badly), ride a road bike (slightly less badly), and mix cocktails (even when it's bad, it's good).
