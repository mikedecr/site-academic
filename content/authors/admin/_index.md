## &nbsp;

I am a quantitative researcher in high-frequency trading, which means I use statistics to analyze financial markets and develop principled trading strategies.

I specialize in Bayesian statistical methods for predictive modeling (a.k.a. "machine learning") and causal inference.

You can also find me on [Github](https://www.github.com/mikedecr), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-decrescenzo-95467953/), and [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/mikedecr).

I am a statistical researcher working in quantitative/high-frequency finance.

I specialize in Bayesian methods for generative modeling, predictive models/machine learning, and causal inference.

I hold a PhD in political science from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where I developed Bayesian methods to study U.S. elections and public opinion.
